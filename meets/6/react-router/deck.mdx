* Route provides a path to the component that we want to render:

 ```/home/about-me```

* Routing is organizing the structure of the whole application.

# Routing in SPA vs MPA

What is the difference between Single Page Apps (SPA) and Multi Page Apps (MPA) ?
* SPA dynamically rewrites the current page
* MPA requires re-render on every page change
* SPA loads only once, but all the resources needed
* whereas MPA queries every new page with a server returning only the exactly needed resource

# Why not just use pure React?

* Difficult to extract the parameters of multiple queries
* Prone to bugs/errors.

And well...

# react-router
* Routes are treated just like components
```
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <nav>
      <Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
    </nav>
    <div>
      <Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

#  HashRouter

  * uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL
  * doesn't look so nice: `example.com/#/react/route`, but
  * works without additional config
  * you can bookmark links

<Footer></Footer>

---

# BrowserRouter

  * uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) <br/>
  to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
  * it's unavailable for legacy browsers (IE 9)
  * looks cleaner: `example.com/react/route`, but
  * needs extra configuration


<Footer></Footer>

---

# memo

* While using `BrowserRouter` or `Router`, it will work fine on our node server, but:
  * To make it work also after deployment we have to configure __.htaccess__ file
  * It can be used to alter the configuration of the Apache Web Server

* `HASH Routing (#)` will not lead to server request.
  * It won't require additional config!

<Footer></Footer>

---

# So.. How do I nest the route?
* The same as a simple ```<div>```
* Route is just a component, so to nest a Route or a div - you do it the same way!
